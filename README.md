Overwatch Stats Collector - bind to a hotkey and save your SR/winrate at a point in time!

Ever check your SR at the end of a season and wonder how you lost 1000 points? I can't do everything, but I can help show you when you started trending down! 

# Project Status
There's no code here, is there?

# MVP Goals

1. Listens for a hotkey,
2. Grabs your overwatch stats at that moment in time, and
3. Saves them to a CSV file

* requests
* BeautifulSoup

# Future Goals:
